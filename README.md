Product Management Trainee assignment

This repository contains my submission for the Product Management Trainee assignment.

##  Problem
Cloud security engineers struggle to prioritize cloud misconfigurations because dashboards show many “critical” issues without enough context on exposure, environment, or business impact.

##  Solution
I designed a 3-screen Cloud Posture Dashboard that helps engineers:
1. Quickly see what matters most
2. Understand *why* an issue is risky
3. Take the right next action without manual correlation
